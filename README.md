# Pong-Extreme
This C# game was built with XNA on Visual Studio 2008 for the "Pong game challenge" for the 48h challenge of Ludum Dare.

#Description
2 players moving like "snakes" try to send the ball against the opponent's wall. 
Between them multiple items appear to give power-ups to the player who hits them.
